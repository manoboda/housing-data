#EDA analsis

1. Histogram of log price shows that there are outliters with high price of housing. The histogram starts tapering after log_price is 6. SO used that as value to filter out those values to remove outlier for anlaysis. 
2. Group-by zipcode, to determine if prices are dependant on location. The plot of price_logmean vs zipcode shows that some zip codes have higher sales compared to others. SO zipcode is factor. Latitue and Longitude is similar to location. SO didn't use those 2 parameters for this analysis. 
Reviewed plot wrt zipcodend mean_logprice, there are some areas which has more cost price. we can review wrt zip code filter ones greater than mean values and check other aspects. There are some houses which have high prices, which can be outlier. After filtering data and running with zip code, it still shows similar trend. 
3. Ran similar analysis for houses with log_price > 6, to see if zipcode has any impact. And it shows same analysis as before. 
4. Log_price vs sqft_living plot shows a condition impacts the price. Ran with rooms, rooms also indicate correlation to price. 
5. Log_price vs sqft_living15 plot shows this factor impacts the price. Similar plot ran with sqft_lot15, there is some correlation, but not major like the sqft_living15. 
6. Group_by year and ploted yr_built vs mean of log_price and there is a correlation. Data also shows that sqft_living is hihger for houses built later than 1950. It may be reason why the price of house is higher . mean sqft_living to year built, shows that sqft_living is increasing in general, which explains why price is increasing. So, year may not be major factor. So the feature of new built may not be impactful 
7. PLot with waterfront and log_price, box plot shows no impact, it may be other factor that impacted price 
8. PLot with grade vs log_price, shows higher the grade, there is increase in price. 
9. Plot with sqft_above & sqft_basement also has impact on cost, but that would be included in the sqft_living, having basement is an engineering feature added, so we can use that instead of the other parameters. 
7. Reviewing plot, price factors may be zipcode, sqft_living, rooms, good view, year_built, grade, is_basement
